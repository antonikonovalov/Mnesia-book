# 2 Getting Started with Mnesia

This chapter introduces Mnesia. Following a brief discussion about the first initial setup, a Mnesia database example is demonstrated. This database example will be referenced in the following chapters, where this example is modified in order to illustrate various program constructs. In this chapter, the following mandatory procedures are illustrated by examples:

* Starting an Erlang session and specifying a directory for the Mnesia database.
* Initializing a database schema.
* Starting Mnesia and creating the required tables.
